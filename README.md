## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I'm Michael Edelstone, a designer living and working remotely in [San Marcos, TX, USA](https://goo.gl/maps/RF69xpHXDVu), a neat little college town between Austin and San Antonio in the Central U.S. time zone. I'm originally from Pittsburgh, PA and have also lived briefly in Flagstaff, AZ and Minneapolis, MN.

I've been a digital designer [since around 2009](https://github.com/edelstone/my-first-website). Before that I was a pro bicycle mechanic, and before that I managed an independent video store. I went to the University of Pittsburgh and got a degree in history, which taught me how to think critically but hasn't been something I've utilized much otherwise.

I'm a minimalist, an introvert, and I have an [older dog named Chloe](https://photos.app.goo.gl/dZmnf8guXIF7MCxw1) who I go on road trips and hike with a lot. I have a wide variety of interests and love learning, so I'm open to conversations on just about anything.

## Media I consume ðŸ“š
 - **Music:** I primarily listen to music on Google Play Music mixed with some ambient backgrounds from [A Soft Murmur](http://asoftmurmur.com/) or [Generative.fm](https://generative.fm/). It's real nice for getting into a flow. My listening habits are on [Last.fm](http://www.last.fm/user/tsanzer).
 - **Podcasts:** I use the Overcast app primarily; it's not perfect but it's the best I've found for iOS. My favorite shows lately are EconTalk, Intelligence Squared, and The Fifth Column.
 - **Reading:** I finish an audio book about once a week; mostly non-fiction stuff. I usually scan headlines on Google or Reddit News, and generally avoid social media, because it's terrible.
 - **TV:** Some of my favorite series (living or dead) are 30 for 30, Eastbound and Down, Futurama, The IT Crowd, Seinfeld, and Community.

## Interesting tidbits ðŸ¤”
 - I recently lost 75 pounds, and then promptly gained almost all of it back. I plan to lose it all again.
 - I watch *a lot* of movies.
 - I lived in Israel for a couple years.
 - [I visit National Parks often](https://drive.google.com/open?id=18UmsEMmCnD-Nw_pzG3fmYnuURfY&usp=sharing). My favorite park (so far) is Sequoia, with Great Basin as a close second.
 - I might move to a remote place or somewhere in the countryside in the near future. I like the quiet.

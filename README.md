## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
**I'm Michael Edelstone**, a designer living and working remotely in [San Marcos, TX, USA](https://goo.gl/maps/RF69xpHXDVu), a neat little college town located between Austin and San Antonio in the Central U.S. time zone. I'm originally from Pittsburgh, PA and have also lived in Flagstaff, AZ and Minneapolis, MN.

I've been a digital designer [since around 2009](https://github.com/edelstone/my-first-website). Before that I was a pro bicycle mechanic, and before that I worked in movie theaters and managed an independent video store. I went to the University of Pittsburgh and got a degree in history, which taught me how to think critically but hasn't been something I've utilized much otherwise.

I'm a minimalist, and I have an [older dog named Chloe](https://photos.app.goo.gl/dZmnf8guXIF7MCxw1) who I hike and go on road trips  with a lot. I have a wide variety of interests and love learning, so I'm open to conversations on just about anything.

## Media I consume ðŸ“š
 - **Music:** I primarily listen to music on Google Play Music mixed with some ambient backgrounds via [A Soft Murmur](http://asoftmurmur.com/) or [Listen to the Clouds](http://listentothe.cloud/). It's real nice for getting into a flow. My listening stats are on [Last.fm](http://www.last.fm/user/tsanzer).
 - **Podcasts:** I use the Overcast app primarily; it's not perfect but it's the best I've found for iOS. My favorite shows lately are EconTalk, Intelligence Squared, and The Fifth Column.
 - **Reading:** I follow a lot of blogs, scan headlines on Google News, and usually check in with The Economist and Smashing Magazine on a regular basis. I avoid social media for the most part, because it's terrible.
 - **TV:** Some of my favorite series (living or dead) are 30 for 30, Eastbound and Down, Futurama, Better Call Saul, The IT Crowd, Seinfeld, and Community.

## Interesting tidbits ðŸ¤”
 - I recently lost 75 pounds, and then promptly gained almost all of it back. I plan to lose it all again, hopefully permanently.
 - I watch a lot of movies. I'm not proud of all of them.
 - I lived in Israel for a couple years.
 - [I visit National Parks often](https://drive.google.com/open?id=18UmsEMmCnD-Nw_pzG3fmYnuURfY&usp=sharing). My favorite (so far) is Sequoia National Park with Great Basin as a close second.
 - I might move to a remote place or somewhere in the countryside in the near future. Maybe the desert. I like the quiet.

## Quick bio
Hi there. I'm Michael Edelstone, a designer working remotely with [Action Verb](http://actionverb.com/). I live in [San Marcos, Texas, USA](https://goo.gl/maps/XV5BuN1iLfM2), which is a cool little college town located between Austin and San Antonio in the Central U.S. time zone.

I'm a minimalist type of person. I have an [older dog named Chloe](https://goo.gl/photos/fPjx3izDvSSz9euR7) who I walk with a lot. I've been a designer since around 2009. Before that I was a pro bicycle mechanic, and before that I worked in movie theaters and managed an independent video store. I went to the University of Pittsburgh and got a (mostly) useless degree in History.

## Tools I use
 - **Design:** Chrome DevTools, Photoshop, Balsamiq, InVision
 - **Code:** HTML, CSS, Sass, UI frameworks, Git
 - **Learning:** vanilla JavaScript, Framer, React
 - **Productivity:** Things, Evernote, Slack, [Pinboard](https://pinboard.in/u:tsanzer)
 - **Code editor:** Atom
 - **Browser:** Chrome

## Media I consume
 - **Music:** I listen to music on Google Play with some ambient backgrounds via [A Soft Murmur](http://asoftmurmur.com/) or [Listen to the Clouds](http://listentothe.cloud/). My stats are on [Last.fm](http://www.last.fm/user/tsanzer).
 - **Podcasts:** I use the Overcast app. My favorite shows lately are EconTalk, Unregistered, Intelligence Squared, and The Fifth Column.
 - **Reading:** I follow a lot of blogs, scan headlines on Google News, and usually check in with The Economist and Smashing Magazine on a regular basis. I avoid social media for the most part.

## Interesting tidbits
 - I recently lost 75 pounds.
 - [I watch a lot of movies](http://www.imdb.com/list/ls062779538/?sort=created:desc). I'm not proud of all of them.
 - I lived in Israel for several years.
 - [I visit National Parks often](https://drive.google.com/open?id=18UmsEMmCnD-Nw_pzG3fmYnuURfY&usp=sharing). My favorite (so far) is Sequoia National Park with Great Basin as a close second.
 - I might move to New Mexico sometime soon, or be a nomad for a while.

**Feel free to ask me about anything!**

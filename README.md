## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I'm Michael Edelstone, a designer living and working remotely in [San Marcos, Texas](https://goo.gl/maps/RF69xpHXDVu), a  little college town between Austin and San Antonio in the Central U.S. time zone.

I've been a digital designer [since 2009](https://edelstone.github.io/my-first-website/). Before that I was a pro bicycle mechanic, and before that I managed an independent video store. I went to the University of Pittsburgh and got a degree in history, which taught me how to think critically but hasn't been something I've utilized professionally.

I'm a minimalist, an introvert, and I have an older [dog named Chloe](https://photos.app.goo.gl/dZmnf8guXIF7MCxw1) who I travel and hike with a lot. I have a wide variety of interests and am open to conversations on just about anything.

## Tools I enjoy ðŸ”§

 - **Code:** HTML, CSS, Sass, SVG, Git, GitHub, the occasional UI framework

## Media I consume ðŸ“š
 - **Music:** I primarily listen to music on YouTube Music mixed with some ambient backgrounds from [A Soft Murmur](http://asoftmurmur.com/) or [Generative.fm](https://generative.fm/). It's super nice for getting into a flow. My listening stats are on [Last.fm](http://www.last.fm/user/tsanzer).
 - **Podcasts:** I use the Overcast app. I's not perfect but it's the best I've found for iOS. My favorite shows are Intelligence Squared, The Tobolowsky Files, and Unregistered.
 - **Reading:** I finish an audio book about once a month, mostly non-fiction stuff. For current events I usually scan headlines on Knewz or AllSides, and generally avoid social media because it's terrible.
 - **TV:** My all-time favorite shows include Eastbound and Down, Todd and the Book of Pure Evil, Futurama, The IT Crowd, Community, and The League of Gentlemen.

## Interesting tidbits ðŸ¤”
 - I recently lost 75 pounds and promptly gained all of it back. I'm currently losing it again.
 - I watch *a lot* of movies.
 - I lived in Israel for a couple years.
 - [I visit National Parks often](https://drive.google.com/open?id=18UmsEMmCnD-Nw_pzG3fmYnuURfY&usp=sharing). My favorite park is Sequoia with Great Basin as a close second.
 - I might move to the countryside in the near future. I like the quiet.

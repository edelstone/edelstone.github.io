## Hi there
I'm Michael Edelstone, a designer working remotely with [Action Verb](http://actionverb.com/), the extremely capable team that makes [BrickFTP](https://brickftp.com). I live in [San Marcos, Texas, USA](https://goo.gl/maps/XV5BuN1iLfM2), which is a neat little college town located between Austin and San Antonio in the Central U.S. time zone.

I've been a designer since around 2009. Before that I was a pro bicycle mechanic, and before that I worked in movie theaters and managed an independent video store. I went to the University of Pittsburgh and got a (mostly) useless degree in History.

I'm a minimalist type of person, and I have an [older dog named Chloe](https://photos.app.goo.gl/dZmnf8guXIF7MCxw1) who I go on adventures with a lot.

 - **Podcasts:** I use the Overcast app; it's not perfect but it's the best I've found for iOS. My favorite shows lately are EconTalk, Intelligence Squared, and The Fifth Column.
 - **Reading:** I follow a lot of blogs, scan headlines on Google News, and usually check in with The Economist and Smashing Magazine on a regular basis. I avoid social media for the most part.

## Interesting tidbits
 - I recently lost 75 pounds.
 - [I watch a lot of movies](http://www.imdb.com/list/ls062779538/?sort=created:desc). I'm not proud of all of them.
 - I lived in Israel for several years.
 - [I visit National Parks often](https://drive.google.com/open?id=18UmsEMmCnD-Nw_pzG3fmYnuURfY&usp=sharing). My favorite (so far) is Sequoia National Park with Great Basin in Nevada as a close second.
 - I might move to New Mexico sometime soon, or be a nomad for a while.
